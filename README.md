### [Allied Garage Door](https://allieddoor.com/).
In 1982, my grandpa _Larry Paris_ had began to put a company in motion that is now providing commercial and residential garage door services to the Chicaagoland area 40 years later. We have stayed a family owned, private company since our creation. My mom and uncle had started working for my gramdpa as young adult, and when I turned 18, I followed in the family footsteps and took on a role as a full time employee in our current warehouse. From there I recieved proffesional training and went on to be a residential techician. I install 8 to 12 garage doors in a full work week and have overseen a 60 garage door project at an apartment complex in Aurora, IL.
